As a child, I was always fascinated by the mystique of African cultures. My mother used to sell West African art in Europe, but compared to European culture, accessing knowledge about Africa was much harder. That's why I've spent more than 10 years on a mission to democratize African cultures through various mediums. Sahara Sands is the result of years of experimentation, trial, and error. This project has been a lot of fun for me, and I hope to share that same sense of enjoyment with others.
